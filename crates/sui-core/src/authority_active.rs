    Authorities have a passive component (in AuthorityState), but can also have active
    components to perform a number of functions such as:

    (1) Share transactions received with other authorities, to complete their execution
        in case clients fail before sharing a transaction with sufficient authorities.
    (2) Share certificates with other authorities in case clients fail before a
        certificate has its execution finalized.
    (3) Gossip executed certificates digests with other authorities through following
        each other and using push / pull to execute certificates.
    (4) Perform the active operations necessary to progress the periodic checkpointing
        protocol.

    This component manages the root of all these active processes. It spawns services
    and tasks that actively initiate network operations to progress all these
    processes.

    Some ground rules:
    - The logic here does nothing "privileged", namely any process that could not
      have been performed over the public authority interface by an untrusted
      client.
    - All logic here should be safe to the ActiveAuthority state being transient
      and multiple instances running in parallel per authority, or at untrusted
      clients. Or Authority state being stopped, without its state being saved
      (loss of store), and then restarted some time later.
