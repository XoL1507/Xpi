/// A Workload is used to generate multiple payloads during setup phase with `make_test_payloads()`
/// which are added to a local queue. We execute transactions (the queue is drained based on the
/// target qps i.e. for 100 tps, the queue will be popped 100 times every second) with those payloads
/// and generate new payloads (which are enqueued back to the queue) with the returned effects. The
/// total number of payloads to generate depends on how much transaction throughput we want and the
/// maximum number of transactions we want to have in flight. For instance, for a 100 target_qps and
/// in_flight_ratio of 5, a maximum of 500 transactions is expected to be in flight and that many
/// payloads are created.
