//! EventStore API supports high velocity event ingestion plus flexible event querying.
//! Multiple use cases supported:
//! - Explorer reads of different events
//! - Filtering of events per Move package, type, or other fields
//! - Persistent/reliable streaming, which needs to recover filtered events from a marker
//!   or point in time
//!   
//! Events are also archived into checkpoints so this API should support that as well.
//!
