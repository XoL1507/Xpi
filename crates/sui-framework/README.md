# Sui Programmability with Move

This is a proof-of-concept Move standard library for Sui (`sources/`), along with several examples of programs that Sui users might want to write (`examples`). `custom_object_template.move` is a good starting point for understanding the proposed model.

To set up and build the [Sui CLI client](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client) needed for Move development, follow the instructions to [install Sui](https://docs.sui.io/build/install).
