# Sui TypeScript SDK Quick Start

The Sui TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the Sui blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a Sui or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/sui.js
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for Sui networks.

| Network | Full node                             | faucet                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| local   | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (default)     | `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas` (default) |
| Devnet  | `https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443`  | `https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/gas`    |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | `https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/gas`   |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` | `null`                                |

## Migrate to version 0.38.0

The Sui TypeScript SDK was refactored beginning with version 0.38.0. If you are updating from an
earlier version of the SDK, there are some changes you should consider when updating your code.

### Module structure

The Sui TypeScript SDK is now divided into modular components. Before version 0.38.0, you imported
the complete SDK module. Now, you upload the individual packages of the SDK module instead. See the
[Architecture section](#architecture) for the list of packages.

### Deprecated classes

The Sui TypeScript SDK deprecates the following classes with version 0.38.0:

- `JsonRpcProvider` - The `JsonRpcProvider` class is deprecated in favor of the `suiClient` class
  when creating a client for a Sui network. See [Network Interactions with SuiClient](sui-client)
  for more information.
- `SignerWithProver` and `RawSigner` - Key pairs now directly support signing transactions and
  messages without the need of a `Signer` class. See the [Key pairs](cryptography/keypairs) topic
  for more information.
- `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - This method was not deprecated, but is now part of `SuiClient`.
- `Connection` classes - The `Connection` classes (`Connection`, `devnetConnection`, and so on) have
  been deprecated in favor of using `suiClient` for establishing the connection. See
  [Network Interactions with SuiClient](sui-client) for more information.
- The `superstruct` type definitions for `JsonRPCProvider` types are replaced with generated types
  exported from `@mysten/sui.js/client`. The new type definitions are pure TypeScript types that you
  can't use for runtime validation.
- A more stable JSON-RPC API has reduced the need for many of the SDK "getter" methods, which are
  now deprecated.

### Signing transaction blocks

Signing and sending transaction blocks changes slightly with the deprecation of the `Signer`
pattern. For an example of transaction signing, see the
[Sui Programmable Transaction Blocks Basics](basics) topic.

### Faucet requests

The ability to request SUI from a faucet is not part of `SuiClient` as it was with
`JsonRpcProvider`. Instead, you must use the `requestSuiFromFaucetV0` method from
`@mysten/sui.js/faucet`. The `@mysten/sui.js/faucet` import also provides a `getFaucetHost` method
to retrieve the faucet URL for `localnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` networks.

```ts
import { getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV0 } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';

await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<SUI_ADDRESS>',
});
```

## Module packages

The SDK contains a set of modular packages that you can use independently or together. Import just
what you need to keep your code light and compact.

- [`@mysten/sui.js/client`](/typescript/sui-client) - A client for interacting with Sui RPC nodes.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/bcs`](/typescript/bcs) - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for Sui.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/transaction`](/typescript/transaction-building/basics) - Utilities for building
  and interacting with transactions.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/keypairs/*`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Modular exports for specific
  KeyPair implementations.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/verify`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs#verifying-signatures-without-a-key-pair) -
  Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/cryptography`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Shared types and classes for
  cryptography.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/multisig`](/typescript/cryptography/multisig) - Utilities for working with
  multisig signatures.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/utils`](/typescript/utils) - Utilities for formatting and parsing various Sui
  types.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/faucet`](/typescript/faucet) - Methods for requesting SUI from a faucet.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/zklogin`](/typescript/zklogin) - Utilities for working with zkLogin. (Note
  @mysten/zklogin package also contains zklogin related functionality)
