# Building Offline

To build a transaction block offline (with no `client` required), you need to fully define all of
your input values and gas configuration (see the following example). For pure values, you can
provide a `Uint8Array` which is used directly in the transaction. For objects, you can use the
`Inputs` helper to construct an object reference.

```tsx
import { Inputs } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

// for pure values
txb.pure(pureValueAsBytes);

// for owned or immutable objects
txb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({ digest, objectId, version }));

// for shared objects
txb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({ objectId, initialSharedVersion, mutable }));
```

You can then omit the `client` object when calling `build` on the transaction. Any required data
that is missing throws an error.
