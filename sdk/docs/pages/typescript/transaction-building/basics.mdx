# Sui Programmable Transaction Blocks Basics

This example starts by constructing a transaction block to send SUI. To construct transactions
blocks, import the `TransactionBlock` class and construct it:

```tsx
import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

const txb = new TransactionBlock();
```

You can then add transactions to the transaction block.

```tsx
// create a new coin with balance 100, based on the coins used as gas payment
// you can define any balance here
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [100]);

// transfer the split coin to a specific address
txb.transferObjects([coin], '0xSomeSuiAddress');
```

You can attach multiple transactions of the same type to a transaction block, as well. For example,
to get a list of transfers and iterate over them to transfer coins to each of them:

```tsx
interface Transfer {
	to: string;
	amount: number;
}

// procure a list of some Sui transfers to make
const transfers: Transfer[] = getTransfers();

const txb = new TransactionBlock();

// first, split the gas coin into multiple coins
const coins = txb.splitCoins(
	txb.gas,
	transfers.map((transfer) => transfer.amount),
);

// next, create a transfer transaction for each coin
transfers.forEach((transfer, index) => {
	txb.transferObjects([coins[index]], transfer.to);
});
```

After you have the transaction block defined, you can directly execute it with a signer using
`signAndExecuteTransactionBlock`.

```tsx
client.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({ signer: keypair, transactionBlock: txb });
```

## Transactions

Programmable Transaction blocks have two key concepts: inputs and transactions.

Transactions are steps of execution in the transaction block. Each Transaction in a TransactionBlock
takes a set of inputs, and produces results. The inputs for a transaction depend on the kind of
transaction. Sui supports following transactions:

- `txb.splitCoins(coin, amounts)` - Creates new coins with the defined amounts, split from the
  provided coin. Returns the coins so that it can be used in subsequent transactions.
  - Example: `txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [100, 200])`
- `txb.mergeCoins(destinationCoin, sourceCoins)` - Merges the sourceCoins into the destinationCoin.
  - Example: `txb.mergeCoins(txb.object(coin1), [txb.object(coin2), txb.object(coin3)])`
- `txb.transferObjects(objects, address)` - Transfers a list of objects to the specified address.
  - Example: `txb.transferObjects([txb.object(thing1), txb.object(thing2)], myAddress)`
- `txb.moveCall({ target, arguments, typeArguments  })` - Executes a Move call. Returns whatever the
  Sui Move call returns.
  - Example:
    `txb.moveCall({ target: '0x2::devnet_nft::mint', arguments: [txb.pure.string(name), txb.pure.string(description), txb.pure.string(image)] })`
- `txb.makeMoveVec({ type, objects })` - Constructs a vector of objects that can be passed into a
  `moveCall`. This is required as there’s no way to define a vector as an input.
  - Example: `txb.makeMoveVec({ objects: [txb.object(id1), txb.object(id2)] })`
- `txb.publish(modules, dependencies)` - Publishes a Move package. Returns the upgrade capability
  object.

## Passing inputs to a transaction

Transaction inputs can be provided in a number of different ways, depending on the transaction, and
the type of value being provided.

#### JavaScript values

For specific transaction arguments (`amounts` in `splitCoins`, and `address` in `transferObjects`)
the expected type is known ahead of time, and you can directly pass raw javascript values when
calling the transaction method. appropriate Move type automatically.

```ts
// the amount to split off the gas coin is provided as a pure javascript number
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [100]);
// the address for the transfer is provided as a pure javascript string
txb.transferObjects([coin], '0xSomeSuiAddress');
```

#### Pure values

When providing inputs that are not on chain objects, the values must be serialized as

[BCS](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/bcs), which can be done using `txb.pure` eg,
`txb.pure.address(address)` or `txb.pure(bcs.vector(bcs.U8).serialize(bytes))`.

`txb.pure` can be called as a function that accepts a SerializedBcs object, or as a namespace that
contains functions for each of the supported types.

```ts
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [txb.pure.u64(100)]);
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [txb.pure(bcs.U64.serialize(100))]);
txb.transferObjects([coin], txb.pure.address('0xSomeSuiAddress'));
txb.transferObjects([coin], txb.pure(bcs.Address.serialize('0xSomeSuiAddress')));
```

#### Object references

To use an on chain object as a transaction input, you must pass a reference to that object. This can
be done by calling `txb.object` with the object id. Transaction arguments that only accept objects
(like `objects` in `transferObjects`) will automatically treat any provided strings as objects ids.
For methods like `moveCall` that accept both objects and other types, you must explicitly call
`txb.object` to convert the id to an object reference.

```ts
// Object IDs can be passed to some methods like (transferObjects) directly
txb.transferObjects(['0xSomeObject'], 'OxSomeAddress');
// txb.object can be used anywhere an object is accepted
txb.transferObjects([txb.object('0xSomeObject')], 'OxSomeAddress');

txb.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::nft::mint',
	// object IDs must be wrapped in moveCall arguments
	arguments: [txb.object('0xSomeObject')],
});

// txb.object automaically converts the object ID to receiving transaction arguments if the moveCall expects it
txb.moveCall({
	target: '0xSomeAddress::example::receive_object',
	// 0xSomeAddress::example::receive_object expects a receiving argument and has a Move definition that looks like this:
	// public fun receive_object<T: key>(parent_object: &mut ParentObjectType, receiving_object: Receiving<ChildObjectType>) { ... }
	arguments: [txb.object('0xParentObjectID'), txb.object('0xReceivingObjectID')],
});
```

When building a transaction block, Sui expects all objects to be fully resolved, including the
object version. The SDK automatically looks up the current version of objects for any provided
object reference when building a transaction block. If the object reference is used as a receiving
argument to a `moveCall`, the object reference is automatically converted to a receiving transaction
argument. This greatly simplifies building transactions, but requires additional RPC calls. You can
optimize this process by providing a fully resolved object reference instead:

```ts
// for owned or immutable objects
txb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({ digest, objectId, version }));

// for shared objects
txb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({ objectId, initialSharedVersion, mutable }));

// for receiving objects
txb.object(Inputs.ReceivingRef({ digest, objectId, version }));
```

#### Transaction results

You can also use the result of a transaction as an argument in a subsequent transactions. Each
transaction method on the transaction builder returns a reference to the transaction result.

```tsx
// split a coin object off of the gas object
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [100]);
// transfer the resulting coin object
txb.transferObjects([coin], address);
```

When a transaction returns multiple results, you can access the result at a specific index either
using destructuring, or array indexes.

```tsx
// destructuring (preferred, as it gives you logical local names)
const [nft1, nft2] = txb.moveCall({ target: '0x2::nft::mint_many' });
txb.transferObjects([nft1, nft2], address);

// array indexes
const mintMany = txb.moveCall({ target: '0x2::nft::mint_many' });
txb.transferObjects([mintMany[0], mintMany[1]], address);
```

## Get transaction block bytes

If you need the transaction block bytes, instead of signing or executing the transaction block, you
can use the `build` method on the transaction builder itself.

**Important:** You might need to explicitly call `setSender()` on the transaction block to ensure
that the `sender` field is populated. This is normally done by the signer before signing the
transaction, but will not be done automatically if you’re building the transaction block bytes
yourself.

```tsx
const txb = new TransactionBlock();

// ... add some transactions...

await txb.build({ client });
```

In most cases, building requires your SuiClient to fully resolve input values.

If you have transaction block bytes, you can also convert them back into a `TransactionBlock` class:

```tsx
const bytes = getTransactionBlockBytesFromSomewhere();
const txb = TransactionBlock.from(bytes);
```
