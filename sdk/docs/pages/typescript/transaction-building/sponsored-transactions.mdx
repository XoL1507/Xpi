## Sponsored Transaction Blocks

The transaction block builder can support sponsored transaction blocks by using the
`onlyTransactionKind` flag when building the transaction block.

```tsx
const txb = new TransactionBlock();

// ... add some transactions...

const kindBytes = await txb.build({ provider, onlyTransactionKind: true });

// construct a sponsored transaction from the kind bytes
const sponsoredTxb = TransactionBlock.fromKind(kindBytes);

// you can now set the sponsored transaction data that is required
sponsoredTxb.setSender(sender);
sponsoredTxb.setGasOwner(sponsor);
sponsoredTxb.setGasPayment(sponsorCoins);
```
