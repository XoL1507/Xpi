# Faucet

To get started with the SDK it can be helpful get some Sui tokens to play with. The faucet is a
simple way to get some tokens sent to your address in `testnet`, `devnet` or `localnet` if you are
running your own network locally for development.

You can request sui from the faucet using the `@mysten/sui.js/faucet` package.

```typescript
import { requestSuiFromFaucetV0, getFaucetHost } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';

await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
	host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
	recipient: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',
});
```

The sui faucet is rate limited, so after making this call you may not be able to request more sui
for a while. The exact limits depend on which network you are connecting to.
