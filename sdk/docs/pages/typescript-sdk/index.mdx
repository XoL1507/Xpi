# Getting Started

The Sui Typescript SDK is a modular library of tool for interacting with the SUi blockchain. It can
be used to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and more.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @mysten/sui.js
```

## Overview

The SDK is split into a set of modular packages that can be used independently or together. So you
can import just what you need.

  nodes.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/transaction`](/typescript-sdk/transaction-building/basics) - Utilities for
  building and interacting with transactions.
- [`@mysten/sui.js/keypairs/*`](/typescript-sdk/cryptography/keypairs) - Modular exports for
  specific KeyPair implementations.
- `@mysten/sui.js/verify` - Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
- `@mysten/sui.js/cryptography` - Shared types and classes for cryptography.
- `@mysten/sui.js/multisig` - Utilities for working with multisig signatures.
- `@mysten/sui.js/utils` - Utilities for formatting and parsing various Sui types.
