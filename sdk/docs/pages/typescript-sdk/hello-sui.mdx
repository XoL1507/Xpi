# Hello Sui

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

This basic example introduces you to the Sui TypeScript SDK. The Node.js example mints SUI on a Sui
network and then queries the address to get a sum for the owned SUI. You don't need to use an IDE to
complete the example, but one like Microsoft Visual Studio Code helps centralize more advanced
projects.

## Before you begin

You need an address on a Sui development network (Devnet, Testnet, local). If you don't already have
an address, use the [Sui Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client) or the
[Sui Wallet browser extension](https://docs.mystenlabs.com/wallet) to create one.

You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and a package manager like
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to follow this example, so install them on your system if you
haven't already.

## Start a project

Using a Terminal or Console, create a folder on your system (`hello-sui` in this example) and make
it the working directory.

```sh
mkdir hello-sui
cd hello-sui
```

When you use a package manager to install the necessary packages, it downloads the modules to your
`node_modules` folder and adds the references to your `package.json` file, creating the file if it
doesn't already exist. For this example, you need only the Sui TypeScript SDK:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @mysten/sui.js
```

Your `package.json` file now has a _dependencies_ section with `@mysten/sui.js` listed with the
package version number.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@mysten/sui.js": "^<VERSION_NUMBER>"
}
```

## Get some SUI for your account

Instead of a 'Hello World' output to your console, this example introduces some SUI to your wallet
address. You must be on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network to use a faucet for minting SUI.

Create a new `index.js` file in the root of your project with the following code.

```js
import { requestSuiFromFaucetV0, getFaucetHost } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';
import { SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const SUI_NETWORK = 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443/';
// Replace <YOUR_SUI_ADDRESS> with your actual address, which is in the form 0x123...
const MY_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_SUI_ADDRESS>';

// Create a new SuiClient object pointing to the network you want to use.
const suiClient = new SuiClient({ url: SUI_NETWORK });

// Function to process the JSON that getCoins provides and then return number of SUI.
const balance = (coins) => {
	let bal = 0;
	coins.data.map((coin) => (bal += Number(coin.balance)));
	return bal / 1000000000;
};

// Store the JSON representation for the SUI the address owns before using faucet.
const coinsBefore = await suiClient.getCoins({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

const statusId = await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
	// Use getFaucetHost to make sure you're using correct faucet address.
	// You can also just use the address (see Connecting to Sui Network topic for values).
	host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
	recipient: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// Store the JSON representation for the SUI the address owns after using faucet.
const coinsAfter = await suiClient.getCoins({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// Output result to console.
console.log(
	`Balance before faucet: ${balance(coinsBefore)} SUI. Balance after: ${balance(
		coinsAfter,
	)} SUI. Hello, SUI!`,
);
```

Save the file, then use Node.js to run it in your Console or Terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

The code imports the `requestSuiFromFaucetV0` function from the SDK and calls it to mint SUI for the
provided address. The code also imports `SuiClient` to create a new client on the Sui network that
it uses to query the address and output the amount of SUI the address owns before and after using
the faucet. You can check the total SUI for your address using the Sui Wallet or Sui Client CLI.

<Callout type="note">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
</Callout>

You can also use the [Sui Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client) to perform client calls
on a Sui network.
