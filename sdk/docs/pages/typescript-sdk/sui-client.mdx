# SuiClient

The `SuiClient` can be imported from `@mysten/sui.js/client` and is used to make RPC request to the
Sui network.

## Usage

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

// create a client connected to devnet
const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });

// get coins owned by an address
await client.getCoins({
	owner: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',
});
```

the `getFullnodeUrl` helper provides a default fullName url that can be used for developing. In a
production application, you will likely want to manually define the URL of the RPC provider you want
to use in your application.

## Manually calling unsupported RPC methods

The `SuiClient` can be used to call any RPC method exposed by the node you are connecting to. The
Client has built in methods for most RPC methods, but if there are methods missing, they can still
be called manually using the `call` method of the `SuiClient`.

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });
const committeeInfo = await client.call('suix_getCommitteeInfo', []);
```

For a full list of available RPC methods see the
[RPC documentation](https://docs.sui.io/sui-jsonrpc).

## Subscribing to events

In addition to calling RPC methods, the `SuiClient` also supports a few methods for subscribing to
events:

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
});

const unsubscribe = await client.subscribeEvent({
	filter: {
		Sender: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',
	},
	onMessage(event) {
		// handle subscription notification message here. This function is called once per subscription message.
	},
});

// later, to unsubscribe:
await unsubscribe();
```

## Subscribing to transactions

Similar to subscribing to events, the `SuiClient` also supports subscribing to transactions:

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
});

const unsubscribe = await client.subscribeTransaction({
	filter: {
		FromAddress: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',
	},
	onMessage(event) {
		// This function is called once per transaction.
	},
});

// later, to unsubscribe:
await unsubscribe();
```

## Customizing the Transport

The `SuiClient` uses a `Transport` class to manage connections to the RPC node. The default
`SuiHTTPTransport` makes both JSON RPC requests, as well as websocket requests for subscriptions.
You can construct a custom transport instance if you need to pass any custom options, such as
headers or timeout values.

```typescript
import { SuiClient, SuiHTTPTransport, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	transport: new SuiHTTPTransport({
		url: 'https://my-custom-node.com/rpc',
		websocket: {
			reconnectTimeout: 1000,
			url: 'https://my-custom-node.com/websockets',
		},
		rpc: {
			headers: {
				'x-custom-header': 'custom value',
			},
		},
	}),
});
```
