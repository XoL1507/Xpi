## Building Offline

In the event that you want to build a transaction block offline (i.e. with no `client` required),
you need to fully define all of your input values, and gas configuration (see the following
example). For pure values, you can provide a `Uint8Array` which will be used directly in the
transaction. For objects, you can use the `Inputs` helper to construct an object reference.

```tsx
import { Inputs } from '@mysten/sui.js';

// For pure values:
txb.pure(pureValueAsBytes);

// For owned or immutable objects:
txb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({ digest, objectId, version }));

// For shared objects:
txb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({ objectId, initialSharedVersion, mutable }));
```

You can then omit the `client` object when calling `build` on the transaction. If there is any
required data that is missing, this will throw an error.
