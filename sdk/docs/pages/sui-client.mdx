# Network Interactions with SuiClient

The Sui TypeScript SDK provides a `SuiClient` class to connect to a network's JSON-RPC server. Use
`SuiClient` for all JSON-RPC operations.

## Connecting to a Sui network

To establish a connection to a network, import `SuiClient` from `@mysten/sui.js/client` and pass the
relevant URL to the `url` parameter. The following example establishes a connection to Testnet and
requests SUI from that network's faucet.

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

// use getFullnodeUrl to define Devnet RPC location
const rpcUrl = getFullnodeUrl('devnet');

// create a client connected to devnet
const client = new SuiClient({ url: rpcUrl });

// get coins owned by an address
// replace <OWNER_ADDRESS> with actual address in the form of 0x123...
await client.getCoins({
	owner: '<OWNER_ADDRESS>',
});
```

The `getFullnodeUrl` helper in the previous code provides the URL for the specified network, useful
during development. In a production application, however, you should use the
[Mainnet RPC address](../index#network-locations). The function supports the following values:

- `localnet`
- `devnet`
- `testnet`
- `mainnet`

For local development, you can run `cargo run --bin sui-test-validator` to spin up a local network
with a local validator, a Full node, and a faucet server. Refer to
[the Local Network guide](https://docs.sui.io/build/sui-local-network) for more information.

## Manually calling unsupported RPC methods

You can use `SuiClient` to call any RPC method the node you're connectiong to exposes. Most RPC
methods are built into `SuiClient`, but you can use `call` to leverage any methods available in the
RPC.

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });

// asynchronously call suix_getCommitteeInfo
const committeeInfo = await client.call('suix_getCommitteeInfo', []);
```

For a full list of available RPC methods, see the
[RPC documentation](https://docs.sui.io/sui-jsonrpc).

## Subscribing to events with SuiClient

In addition to calling RPC methods, you can use `SuiClient` to subscribe to network events:

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
});

// naming the function unsubscribe may seem counterintuitive here, but you call it later to unsubscribe from the event
const unsubscribe = await client.subscribeEvent({
	filter: {
		Sender: '<SENDER_ADDRESS>',
	},
	onMessage(event) {
		// handle subscription notification message here. This function is called once per subscription message.
	},
});

// later, to unsubscribe
await unsubscribe();
```

## Subscribing to transactions with SuiClient

Similar to subscribing to events, the `SuiClient` also supports subscribing to transactions:

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
});

const unsubscribe = await client.subscribeTransaction({
	filter: {
		FromAddress: '<SUI_ADDRESS>',
	},
	onMessage(event) {
		// This function is called once per transaction.
	},
});

// later, to unsubscribe:
await unsubscribe();
```

## Customizing the transport

The `SuiClient` uses a `Transport` class to manage connections to the RPC node. The default
`SuiHTTPTransport` makes both JSON RPC requests, as well as websocket requests for subscriptions.
You can construct a custom transport instance if you need to pass any custom options, such as
headers or timeout values.

```typescript
import { SuiClient, SuiHTTPTransport, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	transport: new SuiHTTPTransport({
		url: 'https://my-custom-node.com/rpc',
		websocket: {
			reconnectTimeout: 1000,
			url: 'https://my-custom-node.com/websockets',
		},
		rpc: {
			headers: {
				'x-custom-header': 'custom value',
			},
		},
	}),
});
```
