## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a6690ac7d: Changed the default behavior of `publish` to publish an upgreadeable-by-sender package instead of immutable.
- 0a7b42a6d: This changes almost all occurences of "delegate", "delegation" (and various capitalizations/forms) to their equivalent "stake"-based name. Function names, function argument names, RPC endpoints, Move functions, and object fields have been updated with this new naming convention.
- 3709957cf: Published initial version of library
