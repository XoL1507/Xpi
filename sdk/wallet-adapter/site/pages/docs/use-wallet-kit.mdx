# `useWalletKit`

The `useWalletKit` hook can be used to interact with wallets. This must be used in a component under `WalletKitProvider`.

This hook automatically updates when any of the underlying state changes (for example, a new wallet is registered, or after a user connects to a wallet).

```tsx
import { useWalletKit } from "@mysten/wallet-kit";

function AccountDisplay() {
  const { currentAccount, currentWallet } = useWalletKit();
  return (
    <div>
      {currentAccount}, {currentWallet.name}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Wallet Kit Properties

- `wallets` - A list of wallets that are currently detected and can be connected to.
- `currentWallet` - The currently connected wallet. Defaults to `null` if there is no connected wallet.
- `accounts` - The list of accounts from the currently connected wallet. If no wallet is connected, this will be an empty array.
- `currentAccount` - The currently selected account, from the list of accounts from the currently connected wallet. This defaults to `null` if a wallet is not connected. After a wallet is connected, this will default to the first account.
- `status` - The current state of the UI. Can either be `DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTING`, `CONNECTED`, or `ERROR`.

Additionally, there are three booleans for convenience that are derived from the `status` field

- `isConnecting` - If the status is `CONNECTING`
- `isConnected` - If the status is `CONNECTED`
- `isError` - If the status is `ERROR`

### Wallet Kit Functions

In addition to the hook returnâ€™s properties, there are also functions that can be used to interact with the wallet:

- `connect(walletName: string)` - Connect to a given wallet name.
- `disconnect()` - Disconnect from the currently connected wallet
- `signMessage(messageInput)` - Sign a message using the current account and wallet.
- `signTransactionBlock(signTransactionInput)` - Sign a transaction block using the current account and wallet.
- `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock(signAndExecuteTransactionInput)` - Sign a transaction block using the current account and wallet, and submit it to the chain for execution.
