# Sui Wallet Kit

Sui Wallet Kit is a set of TypeScript libraries that makes it easy to integrate your dApp with users' wallets in the Sui ecosystem.

### Core Features

- **Automatic State Management:** The Wallet Kit removes the complexity of state management related to wallet connections. You can focus on building your dApp.
- **Supports all Sui wallets:** No need to configure adapters or manually define wallets you support. All Sui wallets are automatically supported.
- **Easy to integrate:** Sui Wallet Kit provides pre-built React Components that you can drop right into your dApp, for easier integration
- **Flexible:** Sui Wallet Kit can be used with our React Component, or with just the core React functionality with your own UI. If youâ€™re building outside of React, you can use Sui Wallet Kit Core to benefit from the state management.
