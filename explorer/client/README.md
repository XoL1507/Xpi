# Sui Explorer Frontend

[Sui Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/) is a network explorer for the Sui network, similar in functionality to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/). Use Sui Explorer to see the latest transactions and objects.

# Set Up

**Requirements**: Node 14.0.0 or later.

Dependencies are managed using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). You can start by installing dependencies in the root of the Sui repository:

```
$ pnpm install
```

Currently the Explorer depends on an unreleased version of `sui.js`, the TypeScript SDK for Sui. Therefore, you need to build the SDK first:

```bash
$ pnpm --filter @mysten/sui.js... build
```

> **Note:** If you are updating the SDK and Explorer at the same time, you need to re-build the SDK whenever you makes changes for it to be reflected in the Explorer.

# How to Switch Environment

## Connecting to the DevNet Remote Gateway Server

The Sui Explorer frontend will use the DevNet Gateway server by default: https://gateway.devnet.sui.io:443

```bash
pnpm dev

```

## Connecting to a Local RPC Server

Refer to [Local RPC Server & JSON-RPC API Quick Start](../../doc/src/build/json-rpc.md) on setting up a Local RPC Server. If we wish to locally run the website using a Local RPC Server, then run the following:

```bash
pnpm dev:local

```

Alternatively, having run `pnpm dev`, click the green button at the top of the page and select the option 'Local'.

## Connecting to a Custom RPC URL

First run the following:

```bash
pnpm dev

```

Then, click the green button at the top and select the option 'Custom RPC URL'. Type the Custom RPC URL into the input box that emerges.

## Connecting to the Static Data

The Sui Explorer can also connect to a local, static JSON dataset that can be found at `./src/utils/static/mock_data.json` and `./src/utils/static/owned_object.json`.

For example, suppose we wish to locally run the website using the static JSON dataset and not the API, then we could run the following:

```bash
pnpm dev:static

```

# Other pnpm commands

### `pnpm test`

This runs a series of end-to-end browser tests using the website as connected to the static JSON dataset. This command is run by the GitHub checks. The tests must pass before merging a branch into main.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `pnpm lint`

Run linting check (prettier/eslint/stylelint).

### `pnpm lint:fix`

Run linting check but also try to fix any issues.
