Before being able to publish your package to Devnet, you need Devnet SUI tokens. To get some, join the [Sui Discord](https://discord.gg/Sui), complete the verification steps, enter the `#devnet-faucet` channel and type `!faucet <WALLET ADDRESS>`. For other ways to get SUI in your Devnet account, see [Get SUI Tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins).

Now that you have an account with some Devnet SUI, you can deploy your contracts. To publish your package, use the following command in the same terminal or console:

```
sui client publish --gas-budget <GAS-BUDGET>
```

For the gas budget, use a standard value such as `20000000`.
