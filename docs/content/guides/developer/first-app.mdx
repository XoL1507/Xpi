title: Your First Sui dApp
description: Build your first dApp and publish it on chain. These guides demonstrate the basics you need to know to start your development journey on Sui.
---

Before you can create your first dApp, you must have [Sui installed](./getting-started/sui-install.mdx).

You use Move to write packages that live on chain, meaning they exist on the Sui network you publish them to. The instructions in this section walk you through writing a basic package, debugging and testing your code, and publishing. You need to follow these instructions in order to complete the exercise.

You use the `move` Sui CLI command for some instructions. The Sui CLI installs with the binaries, so you have it on your system if you followed the install instructions. To verify you have it installed, run the following command in a terminal or console.

```shell
sui --version
```

If the console does not respond with a version number similar to the following, see the instructions to install Sui.

```shell
sui 1.xx.x-abc123xyz
```
