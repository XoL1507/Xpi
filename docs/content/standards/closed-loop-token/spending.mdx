title: Spending
---

Because `Token` type does not have the `store` ability, it is impossible to "store" it in another object. Hence, Coin-like approaches to spending are not possible - an application that takes `Token` as a payment won't be able to add it to its balance. To address this issue, `Token` has a "spend" method, which allows "spending" it in one application and then delivering it as a `spent_balance` to the [TokenPolicy](./token-policy.mdx) or burning right away with a `TreasuryCap`.

## Spend Action

`Token` can be spent by calling the `spend` method. It takes the following arguments:

```move
// module sui::token
public fun spend<T>(token: Token<T>, ctx: &mut TxContext): ActionRequest<T>;
```

As you can see from the signature, the `Token` object is consumed. Its balance becomes the `spent_balance` in the [ActionRequest](./action-request.mdx#actionrequest-structure).

## Spent Token

The `ActionRequest` for the "spend" action contains the `Balance` of the spent `Token`, and it can either be confirmed [with a `TreasuryCap`](./action-request#confirming-with-treasurycap) or [delivered to the TokenPolicy](./action-request#confirming-with-tokenpolicy). In the first case, the Balance will be "burned" directly in the `TreasuryCap`, and in the second case, it will be delivered to the TokenPolicy's "spent_balance".

Spent balance cannot be used in any way, and it is not possible to "withdraw" it. The only available action is ["flushing"](./token-policy#consume-spent-balance) - burning the `spent_balance` by bringing a `TreasuryCap`.


## Gating the Spend Action

Normally, the `spend` action should have at least one "Rule" assigned to it to prevent aimless spending, and the recommended way of authorizing the spend in an application that accepts the Token is to "stamp" it right in the function where a spend is performed. For example:

```move
/// Rule-like witness to stamp the ActionRequest
struct GiftShop has drop {}

/// Spend the token and return a Gift + ActionRequest
public fun buy_gift(
    token: Token<CREDITS>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): (Gift, ActionRequest<CREDITS>) {

    // token is spent
    let action_request = token::spend(token, ctx);

    // stamp the ActionRequest as performed by GiftShop
    token::add_approval(GiftShop {}, &mut action_request, ctx);

    // return already "stamped" ActionRequest
    (Gift { ... }, action_request)
}
```
