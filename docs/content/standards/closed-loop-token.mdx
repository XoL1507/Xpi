Closed-Loop Token allows its creator to limit applications where the token is used, set up custom policies for transfers, spending and conversions. It is defined in the `sui::token` module and is a part of the Sui Framework.

## Background & Use Cases

The standard Coin implementation on Sui is an example of an open-loop system - Coins are free-flowing, [wrappable](/concepts/object-ownership/wrapped), [freely transferable](/concepts/dynamic-fields/transfers/custom-rules#the-store-ability-and-transfer-rules) and can be stored in any application. The best real world analogy would be "cash" - hardly regulated and can be freely used and passed.

However, some applications require constraining the scope of the token to a specific purpose. For example, a token that can only be used for a specific service, or that can be used only by an authorized account, or one whose accounts can be blocked. A real-world analogy would be a "bank account" - regulated, controlled by the bank and compliant with certain rules and policies.

Specific domains that can benefit from a closed-loop token include:

- **Loyalty Points** - A token that can only be used for a specific service, e.g. for an airline - granted to frequent flyers and used to purchase tickets or upgrades.
- **Regulatory-Compliant Tokens** - some jurisdictions require certain checks or restrictions on tokens. For example, a token that can only be used by a verified user, or a single operation with a token can have a limit.
- **In-Game Currency** - similar to "gems" and "diamonds" in mobile games: a token that can only be used in a game and granted to players for their actions or purchased. Tokens of this kind are often not transferrable and minted in predefined amounts to maintain scarcity and game balance.

## Difference with Coin

<img className="balance-coin-token" src={BalanceTokenCoin} />

Unlike Coin, which has `key + store` abilities and thus supports wrapping and public transfers, Token has only the `key` ability and cannot be wrapped, stored as a dynamic field, or freely transferred (unless there's a custom policy for that). Due to this restriction, Token **can only be owned by an account** and can't be stored in an application (however, it can be "spent" - see [Spending section](./closed-loop-token/spending.mdx) section).

```move
// defined in `sui::coin`
struct Coin<phantom T> has key, store { id: UID, balance: Balance<T> }

// defined in `sui::token`
struct Token<phantom T> has key { id: UID, balance: Balance<T> }
```

## Compliance and Rules

Closed-Loop Token allows its creator to set up any rules for transfers, spending and conversions. These rules are specified per action in the [TokenPolicy](./closed-loop-token/token-policy.mdx). [Rules](./closed-loop-token/rules.mdx) are custom programmable restrictions which can be used to implement any request authorization / validation logic.

For example, a policy can set a limit on a transfer - X tokens per operation; or require a user to be verified before spending tokens; or allow spending tokens only on a specific service.

Rules can be reused across different policies and applications; and can be freely combined to create complex policies.
