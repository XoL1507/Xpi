title: GraphQL RPC Beta
description: The Sui API is migrating from JSON RPC to a GraphQL RPC soon. A beta version is available to you for testing.
---

:::info

This is a beta version providing a READ ONLY snapshot of the Sui Mainnet and Testnet networks. That is, these snapshots provide data up to a fixed checkpoint and are frozen. The beta version is made available for you to get familiar with the upcoming RPC 2.0 in an interactive manner.

:::

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language designed to facilitate building expressive APIs and services that require complex data querying.

We are providing an early beta version (feature development continues) of the envisioned RPC 2.0, for `mainnet` and `testnet`, where users have access to a READ-ONLY snapshot of the two networks. This is not intended for production-ready applications, but more as a playground to get familiar with the upcoming GraphQL RPC. The [Appendix](#appendix) provides a description on the GraphQL schema. For examples, see the [Query Examples](#query-examples) section.

## Using Sui GraphQL RPC

Currently, there is one available playground for Sui GraphQL Service:
- `mainnet`: https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io/

This instance runs the GraphQL IDE, an interactive IDE with autocomplete support and in-built documentation.

The endpoint can also be queried using `curl` by passing the query to the call:
```shell
# basic query
curl -X POST https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{
          "query": "query { epoch { referenceGasPrice } }"
     }'
# query with variables
curl -X POST https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{
          "query": "query ($epochID: Int!) { epoch(id: $epochID) { referenceGasPrice } }", "variables": { "epochID": 123 } 
     }'
```


## Query examples

An extensive list of query examples is available in the Sui repository: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/ef4c2e592b1e3ebb03803d19fd405ff0b65f7f59/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples. 
This doc collects all the examples into one file: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/ef4c2e592b1e3ebb03803d19fd405ff0b65f7f59/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/docs/examples.md.

Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to data served by the `graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io` service only.

## Limits

To accommodate the rich and flexible nature of GraphQL queries, the service applies various constraints to make sure each request does not use too many resources.  The following limits are in place for the beta:

- **Rate limiting** prevents too many requests in quick succession from the same address.
- There are limits on the **number of nodes (field names)** a query can have, and the **depth (nesting level of the query)** as queries with more nodes, or deeply nested nodes can lead to more database queries.
- Before the service sends a database query, it **estimates the cost of that DB query**, and imposes a limit on this, to catch small GraphQL queries that have an outsized impact on the database.
- There is an overall **timeout** on how long a query can take.

### Limits Introspection

The `serviceConfig` query field can be queried to return the exact limits imposed by the service:

```graphql
query {
    serviceConfig {
        maxQueryDepth
        maxQueryNodes
        maxDbQueryCost
        maxQueryVariables
        maxQueryFragments
        requestTimeoutMs
    }
}
```

Passing the `X-Sui-RPC-Show-Usage` header will prompt the service to add a `usage` extension to the response which includes details on how many of each resource the query did use.  At the time of writing, this is supported for the query's depth, node count, variable count and fragment count.

### Future Limits

As with other parts of the system we expect the limits we employ to evolve as we productionise the service:

- A limit will be added on the total number of output nodes, to limit the negative consequences of small queries that are cheap to run but produce a lot of data.
- Support for estimating the cost to the database will be extended from per-query to cumulative, to account for GraphQL's ability to send multiple queries in one.

There are also a number of areas of active exploration:

- Extending the node count and depth limits to a more sophisticated calculation that limits the number of database roundtrips on the critical path.
- Revisiting the limits on query variables and fragments to be more generous or non-existent.

## Unsupported Features and Known Issues

As this is only a beta version, there are a few unsupported features and/or limitations:
- There are no performance optimizations, thus some queries may be slower than expected
- Executing transactions and other information on-chain is not possible - the beta release is a READ-ONLY service
- Queries requesting stake related information might be a bit slower or fail the first time, depending on an internal cache. If it fails, try again after a couple of minutes.

The following parts of the draft schema are are not available at the time of writing (2023-10-31), either because they are under development or out of scope for this beta.  For a list of supported features, please consult the documentation in the [online IDE](https://graphql-beta.mainnet.sui.io/):

### Top-level
- `Query.availableRange`
- `Query.coinMetadata`

### TransactionBlock
- `kind` is missing structured data for certain kinds of transaction

### TransactionBlockEffects
- `objectReads`

### ObjectOwner
Object Owner refers to any type (`Address`, `Owner`, `Object`) that could own other objects.  The following fields are not supported on these types:

- `nameServiceConnection`
- `dynamicField`
- `dynamicFieldConnection`

### Validator
- `apy`

### Filters
All filters do not support combination (`any`, `all`, `not`) filters, and the following specific filters are to be implemented:

- `ObjectFilter`: Filtering by package, module and type, and filtering by object key (ID and version).
- `EventFilter`: Filtering by event package, module or type.
- `TransactionBlockFilter`: Filtering by the address that paid for the transaction, the start or end time.

### Executing Transactions
Execution is unsupported and out of scope for this beta.

- `Query.dryRunTransactionBlock`
- `Mutation.executeTransactionBlock`

### Subscriptions
Subscription APIs are unsupported and out of scope for this beta.

- `Subscription.events`
- `Subscription.transactions`
