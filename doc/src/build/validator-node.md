title: Run a Sui Validator node
---

To set up and run a Sui Validator node, see [Sui for Node Operators](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/nre/sui_for_node_operators.md).

To successfully connect a validator node to a Sui network, you must have the minimum required amount of SUI to stake. If you do not, the transaction to join the validator quorum fails.

To learn more about Sui Validators, see [Validators](../learn/architecture/validators.md).
