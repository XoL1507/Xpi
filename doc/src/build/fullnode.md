title: Run a Sui Fullnode
---

We welcome you to run your own Sui fullnode! Sui fullnodes run a service that
stores the full blockchain state and history. They service reads, either for
end clients or by helping other fullnodes get up-to-date with the latest
transactions that have been committed to the chain.

This role enables
[validators](../learn/architecture/validators.md) (or miners in
other networks) to focus on servicing the write path and processing
transactions as fast as possible. Once a validator has committed a new set of
transactions (or a block of transactions), the validator will push that block
to a fullnode (potentially a number of fullnodes) who will then in turn
disseminate it to the rest of the network.

**Important**: For potential validators, running a Sui fullnode is an absolute
prerequisite. We encourage auditors, bridges, state mirrors and other
interested parties to join us. At this time, we offer no guarantees on performance
or stability of our fullnode software. We expect things to evolve and stabilize
over time, and we're seeking feedback in the form of [Sui Code Bug issues filed in
GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose) for any problems
encountered.

## Features

Sui fullnodes exist to:

* Track and verify the state of the blockchain, independently and locally.
* Serve read requests from clients.
* Conduct local app testing against verified data.

## State synchronization

Today Sui fullnodes sync with validators to be able to learn about newly
committed transactions.

The normal life of a transaction requires a few round trips to 2f+1 validators
to be able to form a TxCert, at which point a transaction is guaranteed to be
committed and executed.

Today, this synchronization process is performed by:

1. Following 2f+1 validators and listening for newly committed transactions.
1. Requesting the transaction from one validator.
1. Locally executing the transaction and updating the local DB.

This synchronization process is far from ideal as it requires listening
to at a minimum 2f+1 validators to ensure that a fullnode has properly seen all
new transactions. Over time, we will improve this process (e.g. with the
introduction of checkpoints, ability to synchronize with other fullnodes,
etc.) in order to have better guarantees around a fullnodeâ€™s ability to be
confident it has seen all recent transactions.

## Architecture

The Sui fullnode is essentially a read-only view of the network state. Unlike
validator nodes, fullnodes cannot sign transactions, although they can validate
the integrity of the chain by re-executing transactions that were previously
committed by a quorum of validators.

Today, a fullnode is expected to maintain the full history of the chain; in the
future, sufficiently old history may need to be pruned and offloaded to cheaper
storage.

Conversely, a validator needs to store only the latest transactions on the
*frontier* of the object graph (e.g., txes with >0 unspent output objects).

## Fullnode setup

Follow the instructions here to run your own Sui fullnode.

### Hardware requirements

We recommend the following minimum hardware requirements for running a fullnode:

* CPUs: 2
* RAM: 8GB
* Storage: 50GB

Storage requirements will vary based on various factors (age of the chain,
transaction rate, etc) although we don't anticipate running a fullnode on
devnet will require more than 50 GBs today given it is reset upon each
release roughly every two weeks.

### Software requirements

We recommend running Sui fullnodes on Linux. The Sui team supports the Ubuntu and
Debian distributions and tests against
[Ubuntu version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/).

That said, you are welcome to run a Sui fullnode on the operating system of your
choosing and submit changes to accommodate that environment.

Before building, ensure the required tools are installed in your environment as
outlined in the [Prerequisites](../build/install.md#prerequisites) section. Note,
you will fork the Sui repository here rather than clone it as described in
*Prerequisites*. So you can skip that step.

If you are using Linux, install these extra dependencies. For example, in Ubuntu, run:
```shell
    $ apt-get update \
    && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    tzdata \
    git \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    pkg-config \
    libclang-dev \
    cmake
```

## Configuring your fullnode

Currently, the only supported way of running a fullnode requires building from
source. In the future, we will provide Docker images for more flexibility
in how a fullnode is run.

### Building from source

1. Set up your fork of the Sui repository:
    1. Go to the [Sui repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) on GitHub
       and click the *Fork* button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.
    1. Clone your personal fork of the Sui repository to your local machine
       (ensure that you insert your GitHub username into the URL):
       ```shell
       $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/sui.git
       ```
1. `cd` into your `sui` repository:
    ```shell
    $ cd sui
    ```
1. Set up the Sui repository as a git remote:
    ```shell
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui
    ```
1. Sync your fork:
    ```shell
    $ git fetch upstream
    ```
1. Check out the `devnet` branch:
    ```shell
    $ git checkout --track upstream/devnet
    ```
1. Make a copy of the fullnode configuration template:
   ```shell
   $ cp crates/sui-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml fullnode.yaml
   ```
1. Download the latest
   [`genesis`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob)
   state for devnet by clicking that link or by running the following in your
   terminal:
    ```shell
    $ curl -fLJO https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob
    ```
1. Optional: You can skip this set of steps if you are willing to accept the default paths to
    resources. If you need custom paths, edit your `fullnode.yaml` file to reflect the paths
    you employ:
    1. Update the `db-path` field with the path to where the fullnode's database
       will be located. By default this will create the database in a directory
       `./suidb` relative to your current directory:
       ```yaml
       db-path: "/path/to/suidb"
       ```
    1. Update the `genesis-file-location` with the path to the `genesis` file.
       By default, the config looks for the file `genesis.blob` in your
       current directory:
       ```yaml
       genesis:
       genesis-file-location: "/path/to/genesis.blob"
       ```
1. Start your Sui fullnode:
    ```shell
    $ cargo run --release --bin sui-node -- --config-path fullnode.yaml
    ```
1. Post build, receive the success confirmation message, `SuiNode started!`

Your fullnode will now be serving the read endpoints of the [Sui JSON-RPC
API](../build/json-rpc.md#sui-json-rpc-api) at:
`http://127.0.0.1:9000`

## Using the Explorer with your fullnode

The [Sui Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/) lets you configure where
it should issue read requests to query the blockchain. This enables you to
point the Explorer at your locally running fullnode and see the
transactions it has synced from the network. To make this change:

1. Open a browser and go to: https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/
1. Click the **Devnet** button in the top right-hand corner of the Explorer and select
   the *Local* network from the drop-down menu.
1. Close the *Choose a Network* menu to see the latest transactions. 

The Explorer will now use your local fullnode to explore the state of the chain.

## Monitoring

Monitor your fullnode using the instructions at [Logging, Tracing, Metrics, and
Observability](https://docs.sui.io/contribute/observability).

## Updating your fullnode with new releases

Whenever a new release is deployed to `devnet`, the blockchain state is
typically wiped clean. In order to have your fullnode continue to properly
synchronize with the new state of devnet, you'll need to follow a few steps
based on how you originally set up your node. See below.

### Built from source

If you followed the instructions for [building from
Source](#building-from-source), update your fullnode as follows:

1. Shut down your currently running fullnode.
1. `cd` into your local Sui repository:
    ```shell
    $ cd sui
    ```
1. Remove the old on-disk database and 'genesis.blob' file:
    ```shell
    $ rm -r suidb genesis.blob
    ```
1. Fetch the source from the latest release:
    ```shell
    $ git fetch upstream
    ```
1. Reset your branch:
    ```shell
    $ git checkout -B devnet --track upstream/devnet
    ```
1. Download the latest
   [`genesis`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/devnet/genesis.blob)
   state for devnet as described above.
1. Update your `fullnode.yaml` configuration file if needed.
1. Restart your Sui fullnode:
    ```shell
    $ cargo run --release --bin sui-node -- --config-path fullnode.yaml
    ```
Your fullnode will once again be running at:
`http://127.0.0.1:9000`

## Future plans

Today, a fullnode relies only on synchronizing with 2f+1 validators in order to
ensure it has seen all committed transactions. In the future, we expect
fullnodes to fully participate in a peer-to-peer (p2p) environment where the
load of disseminating new transactions can be shared with the whole network and
not place the burden solely on the validators. We also expect future
features, such as checkpoints, to enable improved performance of synchronizing the
state of the chain from genesis.

information about our nodes.
