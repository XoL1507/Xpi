title: Using the Sui Wallet Browser Extension
---

Welcome to the [Sui Wallet Browser Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil). The Sui Wallet Browser Extension acts as your portal to the Web3 world. Follow this guide to install and use the extension.

## Purpose

Initially, the Sui Wallet Browser Extension is aimed at Sui developers for testing purposes. As such, the tokens are of no value (just like the rest of [DevNet](../explore/devnet.md)) and will disappear each time we reset the network. In time, the Sui Wallet Browser Extension will be production ready for real tokens.

This browser extension is a pared-down version of the [Sui CLI client](../build/cli-client.md) that provides greater ease of use for the most commonly used features. If you need more advanced features, such as merging/splitting coins and making arbitrary [Move](../build/move/index.md) calls, instead use the [Sui CLI client](../build/cli-client.md).

## Features

The Sui Wallet Browser Extension offers these features:

* Create, import, and persistently store the backup recovery passphrases (mnemonics) and the derived private key
* Create NFTs
* Transfer coins
* See owned fungible tokens and NFTs
* Display recent transactions
* Auto split/merge coins if the address does not have a Coin object with the exact transfer amount
* Go directly to the successful/failed transaction in the [Sui Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/)
* A demonstration [NFT dApp](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/wallet/examples/demo-nft-dapp) available [in the Cloud](http://sui-wallet-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

See [Demos](#demos) for depictions of these features in play and [Use](#use) to find these features in navigation.
