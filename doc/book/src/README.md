# Sui by Example

What is more expressive in the world of code than the code itself? In this book you'll find examples for most of the features of Sui Move as well as a number of advanced patterns that can be used right away to improve your modules.

All code samples in this book are written with assumption that you use 'Sui Move' which can installed with this command:
```
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch "main" sui
```

Keep in mind that the branch is set to `main`. If you're developing with our devnet - visit [Sui Installation page](https://docs.sui.io/build/install#binaries).
